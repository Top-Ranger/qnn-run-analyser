-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

qnn-run-analyser is a simple tool to extract information from q runs of 
QNeuralNetworks. You can select a folder containing all runs and extract the
following informations from it:
 * average run (including plot)
 * average rounds and fitness
 * standard deviation of average round / fitness
 
In addition to that a 'plotter' is included which can plot a single run.

The tool is using QCustomPlot, which is available under the GPL3+.
